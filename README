DateTime::Event::Easter 1.00

The DateTime::Event::Easter module returns Easter events for DateTime
objects. From a given datetime, it can tell you the previous, the
following and the closest Easter event. The 'is' method will tell you if
the given DateTime is an Easter Event.

Easter Events can be Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Black
Saturday and Easter Sunday. If that's not enough, the module will also
accept an offset so you can get the date for Pentecost (49 days after
Easter Sunday) by passing 49.

For more information, see the POD attached to the Easter.pm file.

INSTALLATION:
=============

Use CPAN or CPANPLUS - there's no config in the process that requires you to
do anything strange.

For those of you who like it the manual way, the recipe is the same as normal:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.

This module contains no XS code and thus should install anywhere.
